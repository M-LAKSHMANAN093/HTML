Mayiladuthurai was a part of the erstwhile Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Nagapattinam district. The town is known for agriculture and weaving. As Mayiladuthurai District is situated in East Coast, fishing plays a vital role on generating its revenue. In 2023, the district was declared as a protected agricultural zone.[1]
